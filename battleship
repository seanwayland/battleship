battle ship game by Sean Wayland
to run start server then start client 
ie startServer.sh [PORT]
startClient.sh [PORT] [HOST]
for example server port 8080 suggest client port 8080 host 127.0.0.1
open 2 terminal windows enter directory with files
sh startServer.sh 8080
sh startClient.sh 8080 127.0.0.1 

Server prints out ships and kills them when hit 
client asks for input and then prints out a record of hits and misses and untried shots
